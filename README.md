# Cifar10-with-Basic Neural Network (PYTORCH)

This time I tried the basic neural network with 4-5 layers and experiments with Cifar 10. The model didnt perform well as it did in MNSIT Dataset as model wasnt able to generalize well in the test dataset. Thus giving me a accuracy of 46%. The epochs I used was 10. Thus this clearly states that Convolution neural network would have been beneficial for this dataset. GPU used for NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1050 Ti
